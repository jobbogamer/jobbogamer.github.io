I like Reeder for Mac a lot (the public beta of version 2 is [available now][1]) but the icon seems outdated in the dock to me. I made a new icon based on the iOS version of Reeder.

Like the old icon, it has two states, one for when there are no new items:

and one for when you have unread articles:

The icons are available to use; download them [here][2].

All you have to do to use the icons is go to Reeder in the Finder, right-click and choose **Show Package Contents**. Then, navigate to **Contents â†’ Resources** and replace the existing icons, `reeder.icns` and `reeder-empty.icns`, with the new ones.

The only problem is the icons will revert to the old ones whenever you install a new version of the app.
