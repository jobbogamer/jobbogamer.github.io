title: "Yes, macOS Picture-in-Picture Works With YouTube"

**Update 17/01/2017**: Joe Kuhns has written a [Safari Extension][sfext] which adds a PiP button
to YouTube videos, as well as Plex, Netflix, and a handful of others. It doesn't add any additional
functionality over what I outline below, but it makes it faster to enter PiP.

There seems to be some confusion about whether Picture-in-Picture, introduced in Safari 10.0 and
macOS Sierra, is supported by YouTube videos. I've seen a lot of people saying it's not possible
because YouTube uses a custom video player, not the standard one.

Yes, it's true that the standard video player shows a PiP button in the playback control
bar, and that button does not appear in the YouTube player.

But PiP *does* work on YouTube:

Just right click on the video twice.
