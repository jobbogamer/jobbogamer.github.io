<p>Around the time version 10 was released, the option in iTunes to &ldquo;Create MP3 Version&rdquo; seemingly disappeared for a lot of people. It turns out, it hasn&rsquo;t been removed from iTunes, but there&rsquo;s a setting you need to change to get it back.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve never changed any settings in iTunes, it&rsquo;s likely the option you&rsquo;ll see if you right-click a track is &ldquo;Create AAC Version&rdquo;. AAC is a great alternative to MP3, since it generally gives better quality, but it&rsquo;s useless for burning MP3 CDs, since you can&rsquo;t burn an AAC track to an MP3 disc. If you try to burn a disc using iTunes and select &ldquo;MP3 CD&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll get this message:</p>

<p>What you need to do is convert those files to MP3 format. However, in order to do that, you need to get back the &ldquo;Create MP3 Version&rdquo; option. Here&rsquo;s how:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Open the iTunes Preferences and then open the General tab of the preferences.

<li><p> Near the bottom is an option which starts &ldquo;When you insert a CD:&rdquo;. To the right of that is a button labelled &ldquo;Import Settings…&rdquo; – click that, and another window will open.

<li><p> At the top is a drop down labelled &ldquo;Import Using:&rdquo;. Change that drop down to the &ldquo;MP3 Encoder&rdquo; option. Click OK on both windows and you&rsquo;re all set to convert tracks to MP3.</p></li>
<li><p> To convert a track to MP3 format, right-click it and choose &ldquo;Create MP3 Version&rdquo;. iTunes will create a second copy of the track in MP3 format.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Once all the tracks you want to burn are in MP3 format, you&rsquo;ll be able to burn an MP3 disc just fine.</p>
