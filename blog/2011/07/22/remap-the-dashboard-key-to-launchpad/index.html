<p>In Lion, Dashboard is given its own space, which is easily opened with a swipe. That means (to me, anyway) that the Dashboard key on the keyboard (F4) is useless. So I remapped it to open Launchpad.</p>

<h3>What you&rsquo;ll need</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://kevingessner.com/software/functionflip/">FunctionFlip</a></strong> by Kevin Gessner &ndash; this allows you to disable the special function of specific function keys.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/os-x-lion/id444303913?mt=12&amp;at=10l7rn">OS X Lion</a></strong> â€“ because, you know, Launchpad is a feature of Lion.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Method</h3>

<ol>
<li> First off, you&rsquo;ll need to <a href="http://kevingessner.com/software/functionflip/">download</a> and install FunctionFlip. It&rsquo;s a preference pane, so you&rsquo;ll be able to access it from System Preferences in the future.</li>
<li> Once it&rsquo;s installed, open it up in System Preferences (it should open automatically once it&rsquo;s installed). In the drop down list on the right, select the keyboard you&rsquo;d like to remap the key on.</li>
<li> Now find Dashboard in the left-hand panel. It should be the fourth in the list. Check the box next to it, which will disable the special function of the key (Dashboard) and turn it into a regular F4 key.</li>
</ol>

  4. Now click Show All at the top of System Preferences and navigate to the Keyboard preference pane. Open up the Keyboard Shortcuts tab once you&rsquo;re in there.</p>

<ol>
<li> In the left-hand side of that tab, click on Launchpad &amp; Dock. Now select Show Launchpad on the right-hand side. Double-click to the right of the selected row to edit the shortcut, then press F4 on your keyboard. That&rsquo;s it! Pressing the F4 key should now show Launchpad!</li>
</ol>

<p>This is especially useful for those of us with a Magic Mouse, since the mouse doesn&rsquo;t have a gesture for showing Launchpad.</p>
