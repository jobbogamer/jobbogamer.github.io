<p>I like to use Emoji symbols when I&rsquo;m using my iPhone or iPad, but I don&rsquo;t like having to keep the Emoji keyboard turned on. I always end up hitting the &lsquo;change keyboard&rsquo; button by accident. I set up a few text shortcuts to the symbols I use the most, but there&rsquo;s no easy way to access the other symbols. So I made one.</p>

<p>I call it EmojiBoard. It&rsquo;s a web app which lists all the Emoji symbols that work on iOS, allowing them to be copied for use in any app. It&rsquo;s laid out in the exact same way as the Emoji keyboard to make it easy to find certain symbols, and there&rsquo;s a recents section at the top which collects the 21 most recent symbols you&rsquo;ve used.</p>

<p>It works best on iPhone and iPad, and will probably work on Android, but doesn&rsquo;t work on desktop, since it relies on touch.</p>

<p>The web app itself can be found at <a href="http://josh-asch.net/emoji/">josh-asch.net/emoji</a>, and it&rsquo;s open source, so the source can be found <a href="http://github.com/jobbogamer/EmojiBoard">on GitHub</a>.</p>
