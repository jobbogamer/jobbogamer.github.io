<p>Version 8.0 of Messages.app, shipped with OS X Mavericks, has a new feature which automatically inserts Emoji symbols when you type common text emoticons, such as replacing &ldquo;:)&rdquo; with a smiling Emoji face. Personally, I prefer to send the actual text rather than an Emoji symbol, but I couldn&rsquo;t find anywhere in the app&rsquo;s preferences to turn it off. After a lot of searching, it turns out the answer is simple. Just click in the text field in Messages and deselect <strong>Edit → Substitutions → Emoji</strong> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and emoticons will no longer be replaced with Emoji symbols.</p>
