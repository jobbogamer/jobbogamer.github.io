<p>With the release of iOS 7, Apple introduced <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/itunes-radio/">iTunes Radio</a>, a service similar to Stations in Rdio or Spotify Radio. Unfortunately, iTunes Radio is only available in the US at the moment – although <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/10/07/apple-to-expand-itunes-radio-to-u-k-canada-australia-new-zealand-and-more-by-early-2014/">rumour has it</a> that the service will be expanding to other countries, including the UK, by early 2014.</p>

<p>However, it&rsquo;s fairly easy to access iTunes Radio now from any country. All you need to do is set up a US iTunes account and log in to that account on the device you want to use to access iTunes Radio. If you don&rsquo;t already have a US iTunes account, follow <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/create-itunes-account-access-usonly-contents-credit-card/">these steps</a> to get one set up without having to enter credit card information.</p>

<p>Once you have a US iTunes account, log in to it from the iTunes store and then return to the Music app on iOS or the library screen in iTunes desktop and you should see a new Radio tab. That&rsquo;s it! You have access to iTunes Radio.</p>
