<p>One of the main features of iOS 6 on the iPad and iPod touch is the ability to use a phone number for iMessage and FaceTime. Unfortunately it’s not the most intuitive thing to set up.</p>

<h3>What you need</h3>

<ul>
<li>An iPhone running iOS 6 or later</li>
<li>An iPad or iPod touch running iOS 6 or later</li>
<li>An Apple ID set up to use iMessage</li>
</ul>


<h3>Method</h3>

<ol>
<li><p> Turn iMessage off on your iPhone. Open <strong>Settings → Messages</strong> and slide the <strong>iMessage</strong> switch to the <strong>off</strong> position.</p></li>
<li><p> Turn iMessage back on by sliding the switch back to the <strong>on</strong> position.</p></li>
<li><p> Turn off iMessage on your iPad or iPod. This can be done in the same way as on the iPhone. If you don’t see a switch labelled iMessage, you should see your Apple ID’s email address. Tap this and then tap <strong>Sign Out</strong> from the menu.</p></li>
<li><p> Turn iMessage back on on your iPad or iPod. If the switch isn’t there, either tap <strong>Use your Apple ID for iMessage</strong> or enter your password, depending on what you can see.</p></li>
<li><p> You should see a notification such as, “+44 7700 123456 was added to iMessage on the iPhone ‘Mr iPhone’”. You will then be asked if you want to use this number for iMessage and FaceTime on the device you’re using. Tap <strong>yes</strong> and iMessage and FaceTime will be set up with your phone number.</p></li>
</ol>
